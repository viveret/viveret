The internet's archive has a previewable version of what I worked on during this time: https://web.archive.org/web/20210331003831if_/http://stackoverflow.com/jobs

Feel free to see how it changes over time - some changes were implemented by me, and many were reviewed or tested by me.

I also contributed to various repositories within the organization.
