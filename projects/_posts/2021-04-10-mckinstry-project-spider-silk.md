## Overview
Project Spider Silk is merely a synonym and alias for the actual name of the project I was working on.
We picked the name because of how much it connected to other applications and how it connected them all to each other in a web. It solved the problem of data silos and friction in working with data. As more connections were made, more possibilities were created, which shaped how the project was built and how it functioned.
